# Hola hombres!

We :heart: to innovate. And as much as we love innovation, we're missing a simple, easy to use platform where we can share our ideas and improve the concept together. Moreover, we would like to know how brilliant our ideas are. For example I don't like :green_apple:s and I prefer :peach:es. But there's a _1.000.000$_ community for apples. So maybe appless are brilliant, who knows... (_I know for sure, but psst_ :smile: Refer to _Contributors constitution_ and feel free to convince me of the opposite).

So we created the idea for...

->![El Bombillo][1]<-

_The muchacho we trust!_

But first, let me start on who's _we_ (at least for now). We're employees of [1&1](http://www.1und1.de/), an internet service provider and web hosting company. Our department decided to learn more about _Microservices_ and _Continuous delivery_ and we'll achieve our goal together. For sure, we need a greenfield project we can play around with. That'll be _El Bombillo_.

## Wishful features

* Share ideas and define it by a title, teaser and longer description
* Search for ideas and see if they already exist
* Form a team, participate our search for contributors to implement your idea
* We're gamers and we need _Gamification_. We feel naked without at least a few badges
* Share documents
* Add external links (e.g. contact, link to code repo)
* Organize your idea by a desired feature-set
* Publish the status and progress of your idea (from _just thought about it_ to _here it is_)
* Blog about the progress
* Communicate, invite people to contribute
* Every user needs at least one more profile (whereelse should we put those badges?)
* Our ideas should be creditted by the community
* We need a calendar to appoint our meetings (... and we love :beer:, maybe it can be combined)
* Upload images (and other files) to illustrate our ideas
* We need recommendations (best ideas, latest ideas, trending ideas, etc.)

## Contributors constitution

* Greet everybody on this project with either a casual _Hola!_ or _Buenas tardes!_ / _Buenas noches!_, depending on the time of day
* We're open minded! We love to experiment and we love to fail, as we learn from our mistakes  and improve our skills everytime. We love controversy and discussion. We're always open to change our mind.
* If you like to address one of your fellas, then call him _Hombre_. **But**, take care with the proper use of this title and always be positive about it... _Always!_ Here some examples for the proper usage of _hombre_:

:white_check_mark: **Good**  

_Hombre, thats awesome! Let me show you how it get's even better!_

:x: **Bad**

_Hombre, that's bad. That's.. just bad._ :unamused:

* We like to honor our hombres in the **Hall of Hombres**. Every hombre who's done the most outstanding job for the last month will be honored and inducted ceremonically (by a simple commit) into the Hall of Hombres.
* We drink _Tequilla_ every time we achieve a milestone! :cocktail:
