# Hola hombres!

We :heart: to innovate. And as much as we love to innovate, we're missing a simple, easy to use platform where we can share our ideas and improve our concept together. Moreover, we would like to know how brilliant our ideas are. For example I don't like :green_apple:s, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a _1.000.000$_ community for apples. Maybe appless are brilliant, who knows... (_I know for sure, but psst_ :smile: Refer to _Contributors constitution_ and feel free to convince me of the opposite).

So we created the idea of...

<p align="center">
<i>The muchacho we trust!</i>
</p>

Maybe you're asking yourself who's _we_ and why we're doing this? We're just some enthusiastic software developpers and we as a group decided to explore the benefits and proper use of _Microservices_ and _Continuous delivery_. We'll achieve our goal together and we need a greenfield project we can play around with. That'll be _El Bombillo_.

* Organize your idea by a desired feature-set
* Publish the status and progress of your idea (from _just thought about it_ to _here it is_)
* Blog about the progress

## Contributors constitution

* Greet everybody on this project with either a casual _Hola!_ or _Buenas tardes!_ / _Buenas noches!_, depending on the time of day
* We're open minded! We love to experiment and we love to fail, as we learn from our mistakes  and improve our skills everytime. We love controversy and discussion.
* If you like to address one of your fellas, then call him _Hombre_. **But**, take care of the proper use of this title and always be positive about it... _Always!_ Here some examples for the proper usage of _hombre_:

:white_check_mark: **Good**  

_Hombre, thats awesome! Let me show you how it get's even better!_

:x: **Bad**

_Hombre, that's bad. That's.. just bad._ :unamused:

* We like to honor our hombres in the **[Hall of Hombres](HALLOFHOMBRES.md)**. Every hombre who's done the most outstanding job for the last month will be honored and inducted ceremonically (by a simple commit) into the Hall of Hombres.
* We drink _Tequilla_ every time we achieve a milestone! :cocktail:
